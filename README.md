## Summary

This code does the following:

- Creates a dataframe with joins with master
- Based on the dataset, finds the Airlines with the least delay
- Exercises multiple groupings like which Airline has most flights to New York
- Exercises secondary sorts like which airlines arrive the worst on which airport and by what delay
- Exercises custom partitioners using airline Id (optimised version of the previous topic)

Currently using the data from January, downloaded from here:
